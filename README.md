### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to determine the company's attrition rate and identify the key factors influencing employee turnover.

### Data source
Analytics Data: The dataset used for this Analysis is the HR Data.csv file

### Tools 
Excel, Power BI

### Data cleaning
The following steps were performed in the Data cleaning phase on the Power Query Editor:
1. Loading the data
2. Changing the data types of certain variables
3. Handling missing values and duplicates
4. Merged the 2 data sets into a single sheet using Merge Queries to create a single data sheet
5. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis
The Data analysis process delivered the following insights:

1. Attrition Rate:
   The current attrition rate stands at 50.21%. To effectively reduce this rate, it is essential for management to proactively address    and resolve the concerns and issues faced by employees.

2. Work Life Balance:

The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Highest Work-Life Balance: Research Scientists have the highest average work-life balance score at 2.514.
* Lowest Work-Life Balance: Sales Executives have the lowest score at 2.469.
* There is a gradual decline in work-life balance as we move from Research Scientists to Sales Executives

3. Performance Rating:

The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Highest Performance: The Research & Development department has the highest average performance rating of 2.51.
* Lowest Performance: The Sales department has the lowest performance rating, standing at 2.48.
* There's a slight decrease in performance ratings from departments like Support, Hardware, and Software (all tied at 2.50) to Human Resources (2.49) and finally Sales.
The chart highlights the need for additional attention to departments with lower performance ratings, particularly Sales and Human Resources, to improve overall department performance


4. Duration of Tenure:

The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Increasing Gap with Tenure: As employees' tenure at the company increases, the number of years since their last promotion tends to   rise significantly.
* After 1 year at the company, the time since last promotion is just 1 year.
* After 10 years, the gap rises to around 5.94 years.
* After 30 years, it reaches 13.69 years.
* By the time an employee has been with the company for 40 years, the gap increases to 22 years.
  This indicates a possible delay in promotions for long-tenured employees, which could potentially affect morale and attrition if not    addressed properly.

### Conclusion 
From the dashboard, we can conclude the following:
1. The Attrition Rate is about 50.21%. It can only be reduced when all the employee issues are addressed by the management
2. The Work Life Balance in some departments and Job Roles are very low highlighting it as a potential reason for Employees leaving. Addressing this issue will reduce the departure of large number of employees
3. Identifying Departments with lower performance ratings and providing them with proper Training and necessary support will lead to better performance grades
4. Providing better Salary structure according to the experience and Performance based Incentives will lead to better employee retention thereby reducing attrition
