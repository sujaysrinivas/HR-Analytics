### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to determine the company's attrition rate and identify the key factors influencing employee turnover.

### Data source
Analytics Data: The dataset used for this Analysis is the HR Data.csv file

### Tools 
Excel, Power BI

### Data cleaning
The following steps were performed in the Data cleaning phase on the Power Query Editor:
1. Loading the data
2. Changing the data types of certain variables
3. Handling missing values and duplicates
4. Merged the 2 data sets into a single sheet using Merge Queries to create a single data sheet
5. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis
The Data analysis process delivered the following insights:

1. Attrition Rate:
   The current attrition rate stands at 50.21%. To effectively reduce this rate, it is essential for management to proactively address    and resolve the concerns and issues faced by employees.

2. Work Life Balance:

The above fig delivers the following insights:

* Highest Work-Life Balance: Research Scientists exhibit the highest average work-life balance score, measured at 2.514.
* Lowest Work-Life Balance: Sales Executives demonstrate the lowest average score, at 2.469.
* Trend Analysis: There is a discernible decline in work-life balance from Research Scientists to Sales Executives, indicating a progressive decrease in work-life satisfaction across these roles


3. Performance Rating:

The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Highest Performance: The Research & Development department achieves the highest average performance rating of 2.51.
* Lowest Performance: The Sales department records the lowest performance rating at 2.48.
* Performance Trend: There is a marginal decline in performance ratings, moving from departments such as Support, Hardware, and Software (all at 2.50) to Human Resources (2.49), and finally to Sales.
* Key Insight: The chart underscores the need for strategic focus on departments with lower performance ratings, particularly Sales and Human Resources, to enhance overall departmental performance.



4.Tenure:

The above fig delivers the following insights:
There is a notable trend whereby the duration since an employee's last promotion tends to increase significantly with their tenure at the company.
* After 1 year of employment, the time since the last promotion is approximately 1 year.
* After 10 years, this gap expands to approximately 5.94 years.
* At the 30-year mark, the duration reaches 13.69 years.
* By the time an employee has been with the company for 40 years, the gap extends to 22 years.
* Key Insight: This trend suggests a potential delay in promotions for long-tenured employees, which may adversely impact morale and increase attrition if not adequately addressed



5. Performance wise Salary hike:

The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Highest Salary Hikes: The Human Resources and Research & Development departments report the highest percentage salary hikes, at 24.71%.
* Progressive Decrease: The percentage salary hike gradually declines through the Software (24.64%), Support (24.57%), Hardware (24.55%), and Sales (24.53%) departments.
* Overall Trend: There is a consistent downward trend in salary hikes across the various departments.
* Key Insight: This trend indicates that the Human Resources and Research & Development departments provide higher average salary increases based on performance, while the Sales department offers the lowest percentage salary hikes.


6. Training time vs avg performance rating:

![Screenshot (912)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c64555f-00cd-4b80-ab11-23d72782dfe9)

The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Training Duration: Training time varies from 1 to 6 hours.
* Performance Ratings: Performance ratings are relatively clustered within the range of 2.46 to 2.52.
* Trend Analysis: The data points suggest a slight upward trend in average performance ratings as training time increases, with the highest rating observed at approximately 2.52 for a training duration of 6 hours.
* Insight: The chart implies that employees who invest more time in training tend to achieve marginally higher performance ratings, although the variation in ratings is minimal.



7. Attrition vs distance from home:
   
![Screenshot (913)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b98262a-6aeb-41f1-912e-09857815f67d)

The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Attrition Count Analysis: The attrition count exhibits significant fluctuations across varying travel distances.
* Peaks Observed: Notable peaks in attrition count are identified at distances of 10 (525), 20 (547), 30 (540), 40 (541), and again near 50 (539).
* Lowest Count: The lowest attrition count occurs at a distance of approximately 40, with a total of 463.
* Key Insight: This graph suggests that employee attrition rates are influenced by the distance employees must travel from their homes, indicating a potential correlation between travel distance and attrition levels.


### Conclusion 
From the dashboard, we can conclude the following:
1. The Attrition Rate is about 50.21%. It can only be reduced when all the employee issues are addressed by the management
2. The Work Life Balance in some departments and Job Roles are very low highlighting it as a potential reason for Employees leaving. Addressing this issue will reduce the departure of large number of employees
3. Identifying Departments with lower performance ratings and providing them with proper Training and necessary support will lead to better performance grades
4. Providing better Salary structure according to the experience and Performance based Incentives will lead to better employee retention thereby reducing attrition
