By leveraging the insights provided by an HR Analytics Dashboard, the HR team can help the company build a strong, high-performing workforce

### Data source
Analytics Data: The dataset used for this Analysis is the HR Data.csv file

### Objectives
The objectives for the Data Analysis process were as follows:
1. To determine the Attrition Rate of the company and the factors influencing it
2. To determine the Work Life balance of the employees working at the organization
3. To determine the Job Satisfaction Rating of the employees
4. To determine the average Hourly wages at the organization

### Data Analysis
The Data analysis process delivered the following insights:
1. The Attrition Rate is about 50.21%. It can only be reduced when all the employee issues are addressed by the management
2. The Dept wise Performance analysis indicates that the Hardware department has the lowest performance rating indicating that the Employees belonging to the Hardware department have to be trained more and any other concern the employees have to be addressed by the management to improve the overall Performance rating of the Hardware Department
3. The Work Life Balance in some departments and Job Roles are very low highlighting it as a potential reason for Employees leaving the organization. According to the Work Life Balance analysis, the least comfortable Job Roles are that of the Sales Executive and the Manager. Addressing this issue and resolving the employee concerns will result in a higher Work Life Balance leading to lower attrition among those Job Roles

### Conclusion 
From the dashboard, we can conclude the following:
1. The Attrition Rate is about 50.21%. It can only be reduced when all the employee issues are addressed by the management
2. The Work Life Balance in some departments and Job Roles are very low highlighting it as a potential reason for Employees leaving. Addressing this issue will reduce the departure of large number of employees
3. Identifying Departments with lower performance ratings and providing them with proper Training and necessary support will lead to better performance grades
4. Providing better Salary structure according to the experience and Performance based Incentives will lead to better employee retention thereby reducing attrition
